        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What is Naan/ Naan Bread?</strong> Naan is an <strong>Indian flatbread</strong> that is popular throughout the Indian sub continent. Traditionally it is cooked in a clay oven called tandoor. The name 'naan' comes from the Persian word, Nan, for bread baked on hot pebbles in ancient Persia.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Baking Soda</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Plain Yogurt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Nigella Seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt to the stand mixer. Using the dough hook, mix the ingredients for 30 seconds on low speed. Alternatively, add the ingredients to a large bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil and all of the yogurt, and mix into the flour. Add ¼ cup water and start kneading on low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl. Add more water if needed, a tablespoon at a time. Knead for 2-3 minutes until you get a soft and stretchy dough.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil and knead for another 30 seconds. If the dough looks sticky, add a teaspoon or two of flour.</li>
            <li>To rest and proof the dough, add it to the Instant Pot steel insert and set the yogurt mode for 30 minutes and cover with a glass lid. Or, you can simply cover the mixing bowl with a damp kitchen towel and set aside in a warm corner for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Dust your hands with flour and transfer the dough onto a flat surface. Using a bench scraper or a chef's knife, divide the dough into 6 equal parts for large-sized naans or 8 equal parts for medium. Roll each dough ball in your palms to make a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, apply gentle pressure and roll each dough ball into a large oval shape, about 8-inches long and ¼-inch thick, using as little flour as possible. If using nigella seeds, spread a few on top and roll once more to press them into the naan.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet on medium-high heat. When hot, using a pastry brush, spread some water in the pan. Place the naan, topping side up, and let it cook till large bubbles start to form (about 1 - 1½ minutes).</li>
            <li>Flip the naan and cook on the other side for another 1 - 1½ minutes. Remove naan and brush with some melted butter or oil. Enjoy warm with your favorite Indian curry.</li>
