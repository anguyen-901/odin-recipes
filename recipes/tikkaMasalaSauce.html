        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What Is Tikka Masala Sauce?</strong> Tikka masala sauce is actually more British than Indian - some even consider it to be the national dish of England! It is said to have been created by a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, in Glasgow, Scotland, who improvised a sauce made from yogurt, cream and spices.

            Well-known British chefs such as Jamie Oliver have brought it into the mainstream.
            
            In true definition:
            
            <strong>Tikka</strong> = an Indian dish of small pieces of meat or vegetables marinated in seasoned yogurt and grilled.
            
            <strong>Masala</strong> = any mix of spices ground into a paste or powder for use in Indian cooking.
            
            <strong>Sauce</strong> = the 'gravy' that ties everything together.

            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Diced Tomato</li>
            <li>Raw Cashew</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Turmeric Powder</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Nigella Seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt to the stand mixer. Using the dough hook, mix the ingredients for 30 seconds on low speed. Alternatively, add the ingredients to a large bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil and all of the yogurt, and mix into the flour. Add ¼ cup water and start kneading on low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl. Add more water if needed, a tablespoon at a time. Knead for 2-3 minutes until you get a soft and stretchy dough.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil and knead for another 30 seconds. If the dough looks sticky, add a teaspoon or two of flour.</li>
            <li>To rest and proof the dough, add it to the Instant Pot steel insert and set the yogurt mode for 30 minutes and cover with a glass lid. Or, you can simply cover the mixing bowl with a damp kitchen towel and set aside in a warm corner for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Dust your hands with flour and transfer the dough onto a flat surface. Using a bench scraper or a chef's knife, divide the dough into 6 equal parts for large-sized naans or 8 equal parts for medium. Roll each dough ball in your palms to make a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, apply gentle pressure and roll each dough ball into a large oval shape, about 8-inches long and ¼-inch thick, using as little flour as possible. If using nigella seeds, spread a few on top and roll once more to press them into the naan.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet on medium-high heat. When hot, using a pastry brush, spread some water in the pan. Place the naan, topping side up, and let it cook till large bubbles start to form (about 1 - 1½ minutes).</li>
            <li>Flip the naan and cook on the other side for another 1 - 1½ minutes. Remove naan and brush with some melted butter or oil. Enjoy warm with your favorite Indian curry.</li>
